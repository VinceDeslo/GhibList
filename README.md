# GhibList 
## A test project for learning JS

This MERN stack application should eventually permit users to create, modify
and view custom lists of Studio Ghibli movies that they intend to watch.

This is a first introduction to Node.js, React.js and MongoDB.
The template of the project is provided by a tutorial on: CodingTheSmartWay.com

Further functionnality will be added to the template after the base project
is built.

## Task List
- [x] Create React.js project.
- [x] Implement basic UI components of the web app.
- [x] Implement back-end with MongoDB for storage of user lists.
- [x] Connect React frontend to Backend with Axios.
- [ ] Implement Login and Register component functionality.
- [ ] Implement back-end for user authentification.
- [ ] Link application to the Studio Ghibli API for resource access.

## Expansion ideas
- Replace user description with expandable synopsis.
- Add a rating system once watched.
